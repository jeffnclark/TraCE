# TRACE: Trajectory Counterfactual Scores

## Required work

### Datasets:
1. Generate simple 2D toy dataset
2. String together some randomly selected points (only in negative class?) as timeseries
3. Visualise
4. Import MIMIC dataset

### Counterfactuals
5. Train classifier
6. Compute counterfactuals
ß
### Compute metrics
7. Cosine similarity
8. L2
9. Product

### Plot metrics
10. Over steps for one person
11. Comparing groups of patients for known outcomes: ie those that were successfully discharged and those that died (the latter are currently not in Chris’ dataset)

### Write paper
In parallel with the above:
12. Seek feedback
13. Write paper - currently aiming for NLDL with 1st September deadline
14. Add nice figures / diagrams
